# DSA for Interviews: A Practical Guide

Hi there! 👋 This repository is a curated collection of Data Structures & Algorithms patterns and problems, designed to prepare you for technical interviews for roles like **Google STEP, Microsoft SWE Intern, Amazon SDE Intern, Meta University (outside Ireland)**, and other top-tier software engineering internships.

It's not just a list of solutions. It's a structured learning path focused on **recognizing patterns**, understanding **trade-offs**, and moving from a **brute-force idea to an optimal solution**.

All solutions in this repository are written in **Java**.

## 💡 Core Philosophy: The Journey to Optimal

The goal of a technical interview isn't just to get the right answer, but to demonstrate *how you think*. That's why every problem in this repo follows a specific structure:

1.  **Brute Force:** The simple, straightforward first attempt.
2.  **Analysis:** Identifying *why* the brute-force solution is inefficient.
3.  **Optimal Solution:** Applying the correct data structure or algorithmic pattern to solve the problem efficiently.

By studying this way, you learn to deconstruct problems and build effective solutions under pressure.

## 🧭 How to Use This Repo

- **For Revision:** Use the checklists below to track your progress and quickly review key patterns before an interview.
- **For Deep Learning:** Dive into each problem's dedicated folder. Every folder contains:
    - `README.md` explaining the thought process from brute-force to optimal.
    - `BruteForce.java` containing the initial, straightforward solution.
    - `Optimal.java` containing the final, efficient interview-ready solution.

## 🚀 Beyond Code: Complexity Analysis

Remember, the solution is only half the battle. For every problem, make sure you can confidently state and defend the **Time and Space Complexity** of your approach. The `README.md` for each problem will include a complexity analysis table.
